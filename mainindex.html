                    <h1>MENTAL WELLNESS  <hr></h1>
                 <p>Your mental health influences how you think, feel, and behave in daily life. It also affects your ability to cope with stress, overcome challenges, build relationships, and recover from life’s setbacks and hardships.
                    Strong mental health isn’t just the absence of mental health problems. Being mentally or emotionally healthy is much more than being free of depression, anxiety, or other psychological issues. Rather than the absence of mental illness, mental health refers to the presence of positive characteristics.
                    Having solid mental health doesn’t mean that you never go through bad times or experience emotional problems. We all go through disappointments, loss, and change. And while these are normal parts of life, they can still cause sadness, anxiety, and stress. But People who are emotionally and mentally resilient have the tools for coping with difficult situations and maintaining a positive outlook. They remain focused, flexible, and productive, in bad times as well as good. Their resilience also makes them less afraid of new experiences or an uncertain future.</p></div>

                        <p class="lead">Music is a powerful tool. Research suggests that music can help combat depression and anxiety, along with a host of other mental health issues. Music therapy is one technique administered by health care professionals to help support people as they strive to improve and gain control over their mental health, functioning, and well-being.
                            Music therapy is a creative and holistic approach to healing, as well as the development of constructive and positive coping strategies. It has proven to play a big role in helping patients recover from negative events and experiences as well as those suffering post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD).
                            Music can also be used to aid in insomnia, helping to encourage and induce a deeper sleep. Many people have expressed how music is a form of ‘escape’, and can quickly and effectively transport them to a better time, place, or memory.</p>

                        <p class="lead">It is hardly a secret that the key to successfully accomplishing one goal after another is learning how to stay motivated. There are, of course, tasks which successful people may not like at all, yet they find motivation to complete them because they recognize how each particular task at hand serves a greater goal.
                        It’s impossible to expect your motivation levels to remain at 100% all the time, but there are things you can do to maximize your stores of motivation and push forward.
                        Mix different approaches, and match them to your task for the best results.
                        Finding good reasons to work on your task is bound to help you feel better, and identifying ways to make it fun will help you enjoy the task even more.
                        Learning how to stay motivated is as simple as finding what works for you. If you need a reward, schedule one. If you just need to find your “why”, take time for introspection. Do what you need to do and start tackling those goals.</p>
